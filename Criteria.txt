Hold high the torch
Let its blaze reach all corners
Throughout the world
to lighten the course of darkness
Keep wise and well not forgetting fidelity
To our Alma Mater, wherever we may be
Keep our hearts together with glowing
love and loyalty
Hold tight the shield
And defend our dear country
We must not yield
To threats made upon our safety
This is the pledge
We shall keep till our dying day
To our Alma Mater, wherever we may be
Keep our hearts together
With glowing love and loyalty
